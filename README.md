sbt-source-align
================

simple plugin for simple-build-tool, compose code and source jars, align sources inside for your favorite IDE

If you want to improve it, please send mail to sbt-android-mill at digimead.org. You will be added to the group. Please, feel free to add yourself to authors.

It is less than 300 lines. SBT source code is really simple to read and simple to extend :-)

This readme cover all plugin functionality, even if it is written in broken english (would you have preferred well written russian :-) Please, correct it, if you find something inappropriate.

## Adding to your project ##

Create a

 * _project/plugins/project/Build.scala_ - for older simple-build-tool
 * _project/project/Build.scala_ - for newer simple-build-tool

file that looks like the following:

```scala
    import sbt._
    object PluginDef extends Build {
      override def projects = Seq(root)
      lazy val root = Project("plugins", file(".")) dependsOn(ssa)
      lazy val ssa = uri("git://github.com/sbt-android-mill/sbt-source-align.git#0.1.1")
    }
```

You may find more information about Build.scala at [https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins)

Then in your _build.sbt_ file, simply add:

``` scala
    sbt.source.align.Align.alignSettings
```

You may find sample project at _src/sbt-test/source-align/simple_

## Usage ##

By default aligned jars saved to _target/align_ Change _update-align-path_ or add to your project something like

``` scala
    alignPath <<= (target in LocalRootProject) map { _ / "my-align-dir" }
```

or

``` scala
    alignPath <<= (baseDirectory) (_ / "my-aling-dir")
```


You may skip dependencies with _update-align-skip-organization_. If you got something like this

```
[trace] Stack trace suppressed: run last *:update-align for the full output.
[error] (*:update-align) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot add dependency 'org.scala-lang#scala-library;2.9.2' to configuration 'provided' of module sbt.android.mill#sbt-android-mill$sbt;0.1-SNAPSHOT because this configuration doesn't exist!
```

add an exception to alignSkipOrganizationin your _build.sbt_

``` scala
    alignSkipOrganization += "org.scala-lang"
```

By default alignSkipOrganization contains "org.scala-lang" and "org.scala-sbt". This setting affects library-dependencies only.

### Align project dependencies ###

1. Download all project __and SBT__ dependencies, sources, javadocs

2. Merge code jars with sources

3. Align sources inside jars

SBT task name

    ```update-align```

It is very useful to develop simple-build-tool plugins. Most SBT source code are unaligned. Original sources saved in root directory of jar, but it binded to different packages. This situation prevent source code lookup in most common situations. This is very annoying. SBT _*-sources.jar_ was mostly useless in development before sbt-source-align ;-)

Developing simple SBT plugin in Eclipse IDE with

* autocomplete
* __sources lookup__
* __debug SBT tasks in Eclipse debugger__ (I asked about debugging in SBT mailing list, but no one can answer. I suspect that others people for debug sbt plugins used print or s.log.debug. lol ;-) )
* implicit lookup
* types lookup
* refactoring support

... and bunch of other standard features

_PS sbt-source-align obsoletes capabilities provided by sbt deliver-local + IvyDE or sbteclipse plugin_
