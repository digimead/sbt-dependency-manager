SBT Dependency Manager
======================

There is a short introduction on Youtube: [Simple-build-tool plugin with Eclipse in 5 Minutes](http://youtu.be/3K8knvkVAyc). It was one of the ealist versions. <br/>
There is a [sample project](src/sbt-test/dependency-manager/simple). Please, overview `test` file which contains interactive example in [Scripted format][sc].

What is it? You may fetch [SBT](https://github.com/sbt/sbt "Simple Build Tool") project artifacts, compose jars with source code, *align* sources inside jars for your favorite IDE

It provides an ability:

* to fetch __all dependency jars (include sbt-dependency-manager itself)__ to target folder
* to fetch __all dependency jars with sources (include sbt-dependency-manager itself)__ to target folder
* to fetch __all dependency jars with sources, merge them (include sbt-dependency-manager itself)__ and save to target folder
* join all fetched artifacts to solid consolidated jar, that simplify project setup and provide rapid develoment dependency for 3rd party. Especially when you have tons of dependencies from different sources: mix of local artifacts, *OSGi* bundles from P2 update sites and ivy/maven libraries :-)

*IMPORTANT. You may fetch artifacts only for those plugins that were added via ```addSbtPlugin``` as jar files. Source code of dynamicaly compiled plugins or dependencies are not fetched. This is expected behaviour.*

You may find the sample project at [src/sbt-test/dependency-manager/simple][sp]
