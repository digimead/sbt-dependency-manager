HD quality [Simple-build-tool plugin with Eclipse in 5 Minutes](https://github.com/downloads/sbt-android-mill/sbt-android-mill-extra/EclipseSBT.mp4) - 60,5Mb

It is allow to develop SBT plugins (and common Scala software too, of course) with

* autocomplete
* __sources lookup__
* __debug SBT tasks with Eclipse debugger__ (I asked about debugging in SBT mailing list, but no one can answer. I suspect that other people using print or s.log.debug. lol ;-) )
* implicit lookup
* types lookup
* refactoring support

... and bunch of other standard features

_PS sbt-dependency-manager obsoletes capabilities provided by sbt deliver-local + IvyDE or sbt-eclipse plugin.<br/> I am using it directly with Eclipse Scala IDE and the development process is flawless._
